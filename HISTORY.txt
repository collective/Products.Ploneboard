SilvaMetadata changes

   0.7.5

     Bugs fixed

       - XML import with unrecognized metadata sets now skips these
         sets silently.

       - XML export for integers and floats should now work properly
         when Python 2.1 is used.

       - Make SilvaMetadata field editing work with Formulator 1.6.0.

   0.7.4 

     Bugs fixed

        - XML import would fail with a NameError if a metadata set is
          imported that is not registered. Now it fails with a more
          informative error... What *should* be happening is that this
          unrecognized metadata is skipped, instead.

   0.7.3

     Features added

        - icon for service_metadata.

     Bugs fixed

        - XML import of complex lists for items now works.

        - Indexing with XML import now works.
       
   0.7.2

     Bugs fixed

       - getMetadataValue was buggy and didn't really work. Fixed.

   0.7.1

     Features added

       - Added Infrae standard release documentation.

     Bugs fixed

       - Avoid quadratic behavior while indexing. Previously, for n
         elements that are indexed, for each element indexing the data
         for the n indexes was accessed, resulting in quadratic
         behavior while indexing (n * n values were accessed per
         object).

   0.5

     Initial public release of SilvaMetadata.
