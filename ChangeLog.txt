    * Fixed tabs in portal_memberdata.  You now will get the standard tabs after
      creation.  Adding actions now works, too.

    * Enabled the option to mail your password to yourself when you change it.

    * Minor code cleanup in the factory tool.

    * Code cleanup in the main test (which still doesn't run because of some
      evil code in Archetypes)

    * Fixed a couple of pretty serious bugs in Member.py that had to do with
      deleting members with user objects that come from outside the current
      portal.  First, the test for the source of the user objects' acl_users 
      folder was broken, which meant that one could delete the site administrator.
      Even worse, when one deleted the site administrator, all the objects they
      owned were deleted recursively, which included the portal itself!  This
      wreaked all sorts of havoc and is now fixed.

    * Updated skins/content_edit.py to work with changes in Archetypes'
      handling of schemata

    * MemberDataTool.py: removed a spurious declaration of registerType and 
    cleaned up the remaining registerType

    * VariableSchemaSupport.py: fixed declaration for getSchema

    * Extensions/Install.py: fixed portal_types icons for MemberArea and 
    TempFolder

    * types/Member.py: 

        - changed formtooltips from an ObjectField to a BooleanField

        - made mail_me read only and require EDIT_PASSWORD_PERMISSION to write

        - improved validate_id error messages

        - updated migration code to reflect changes to Field.py in Archetypes

    * tests/test.py, test_MemberDataTool.py, test_migration.py: 

        - fixed initialization of Zope in unit tests, so all should run.
        Something in archetypes is messing up test.py, and test_MemberDataTool 
        only works with CMF 1.4, but test_migration now works
