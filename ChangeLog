   * Added a forgotten import statement in ControllerPythonScript

   * ControllerValidators don't use actions or validators so the actions tab has
     been removed

   * Fixed the customize function so that it copies actions and validators when
     you customize an FSControllerPageTemplate or an FSControllerPythonScript

   * Renamed classes (ControlledX to ControllerX)

   * Created separate ControllerValidator and FSControllerValidator classes

   * Made new defaults for ControllerValidator and for ControllerPythonScript classes

2003-08-17  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Modified the validation of validators in FormValidator to allow for
     validators in which a directory path is specified.

   * Modified the way that ControllerState objects store the context.  For 
     reasons I don't completely understand, the old way I was storing them
     trashed the stored object's acquisition context (even when they were
     properly unwrapped via aq_inner).  The fix is kind of evil: I store the
     context in a list, so the acquisition context is unchanged by the 
     container.  This will wreak havoc if we ever try to persist ControllerState
     objects, but this shouldn't have to happen, since we just pass around the 
     state objects in the REQUEST.

   * Added a default.html file that has some useful default content for 
     ControlledPageTemplates that are created in the ZMI.

   * Minor corrections and edits to the documentation within the ZMI Validation
     and Actions tabs. Added an example of setting portal_status_message from a 
     script using state.setKwargs() in the docs.

   * Updated the documentation to reflect the new .metadata file method.

2003-07-30  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * Things now work if the validators section of the .metadata file is empty.
     Also fixed problem with ControlledPageTemplateFile not getting the right
     path to the .metadata file.

   * Added instructions for making CMFFormController work with CMF 1.3 to the
     README file.

2003-07-30  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

   * .metadata files didn't load properly if they didn't contain both an actions
     section and a validators section.  Fixed.

2003-07-30 Kevin Teague <kevin@bud.ca> (Wheat)

   * Prettied up the ZMI tables for Default Actions and Default Validators

2003-07-27  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Complete refactoring.  Default properties are now specified in .metadata
      files when appropriate.

2003-07-04  Geoff Davis <geoff@geoffdavis.net> (plonista)

    * Initial check-in
