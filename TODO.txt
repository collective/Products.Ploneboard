V2.0

- I'd like to put a different title on the page and different titles on the singular panels

- API

  - register/unregister skin
  - register/unregister viewlet

- add edit button to each content

- compatible with I18NLayer

  I18NLayer should be transparent. Here is some point in
my mind now.

  1. Viewlets of the actual types belongs to the I18N container
  2. (howto?)Viewlet like recent changes only show the specific languge stuff
 but not the container and other stuff.

- submit to Plone as a portlet proposal

- Also, you mention in the documentation that there are heirarchical content
  panels - I assumed that when you click the 'add panel' button inside a panel
you can do that, but actually it just adds the panel after the one you click.
How do you put panels inside other panels?

  add a new kind of panel - sub-contentpanels, just click a icon, and you can 
work on the new sub-contentpanels. And no need to create a sepreate contentpanels. I just get some ideas to achive this without much effort.
