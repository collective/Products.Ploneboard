V2.0

- support mxmDynamicPage

- add edit content button for each panel

- performance

  You can have a look at the base_panel.pt, perhaps this line is too expensive:

    <metal:block use-macro="here/global_defines/macros/defines" />

  Each panel will call all the defines.
  I think we can define a small set of variables. 

- It looks like you made a better interface for this. Seems to function much
better now, but it is still strange that you can select the "global"
viewlets after you have selected a particular content item.

It seems to me that these two types of viewlets should some how be
distinguished from each other. One is a global viewlet (Plone portlets)
which has no bearing on the context, whereas the other is a viewlet which is
specific to the particular piece of content (or folder) that you have
selected.

Perhaps you should separate Viewlets from Portlets, because right now it is
rather confusing.

- update css to be more compatible with nested contentpanels

- compatible with I18NLayer

  I18NLayer should be transparent. Here is some point in
my mind now.

  1. Viewlets of the actual types belongs to the I18N container
  2. (howto?)Viewlet like recent changes only show the specific languge stuff
 but not the container and other stuff.

- submit to Plone as a portlet proposal

- Local published event/Local published news viewlet

- Also, you mention in the documentation that there are heirarchical content
  panels - I assumed that when you click the 'add panel' button inside a panel
you can do that, but actually it just adds the panel after the one you click.
How do you put panels inside other panels?

UI should be refined, how about this way:
1. in the popup add panel window, user can select to add a new
sub-contentpanels
2. after that, the sub-contentpanels is auto-created in the same folder and
added on the panel with the correct viewlet.

It should be easier to use and the code is still very simple.
