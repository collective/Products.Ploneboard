PloneBoard to-do list
=====================

    Code structure
    --------------

    - Split up posting macros, as entire template is evaluated each time a 
        macro is used.

    - Ensure conversations end up in portal_catalog.
        - Can use ArchetypeTool's catalog multiplex for this
        
    - Would be nice if we could ensure Zope 2.7 compatability at least for
        a little while.

    Workflows and Security
    ----------------------

    - Add more security declarations, use the board permissions everywhere.

    - Various permission bugs (possibly fixed, need testing):

        - reviewer can view moderation-form but doesn't see action buttons to 
            publish
    
        - if you reject a moderated post, it vanishes from the plone UI
    
        - Can't edit posted comment (actually a feature, make sure it works 
            if you change permissions)
    
    UI fixes
    --------

    - Create a single page showing all threads in a board, with all replies in a
        tree view

    - Rename forum_view -> conversation_listing - it's actually a listing, not a
        view
    
    - Need indication in UI when threads are locked or sticky


    Discussion tool integration
    ----------------------------

    - Should have an aggregate page which shows all discussions going on in the
        portal

    Tests
    ------

    - Refactor tests, use PloneTestCase

    Future/nice-to-have
    -------------------

    - Mail/news gateway (bye-bye gmane?)
