Ploneboard to-do list
=====================

    Bugs
    ----
    
    - testPloneboardWorkflow.testPreserveChainsOnReinstall() errors during
        quickinstaller re-install.

        -> re-install works at runtime, so test fixture must be wrong
    
    Features
    --------
    
    - Reporting/highlighting:
    
      -> page for "recent comments"
          - most recent first
          - all/since last log-in
          - link from portlet, each forum, conversation, comment (?)
          - list forum title, conversation title, author, comment count, last comment date
          - 20 items per page, batched

      -> page for "conversations with no replies"
          - permissions to view this?
    
    UI decisions
    ------------
    
    - How/where/whether threaded_conversation_view should be enabled
        - per user preference? per forum?
        - does it cause confusion if different users have different views?
    
    - Whether to use title-to-id generation (with numerical suffixes to remove
        collisions) on conversations, on comments? 
            - note: comment urls are rarely/never shown to the user
    
    Missing tests
    -------------
    
    - Functional tests for threaded_conversation_view (see above)
    - Functional tests for global board view template (see above)
    
    - Coverage of PloneboardTool's transform management is sub-optimal
    
    Code structure
    --------------

    - Split up posting macros, as entire template is evaluated each time a 
        macro is used.
        
    Discussion tool integration
    ----------------------------

    - Should have an aggregate page which shows all discussions going on in the
        portal
    - Should be able to adapt Discussion Item to IComment, discussion
        container to IConversation?

    Future/nice-to-have
    -------------------

    - Mail/news gateway - possibility of integrating with 'listen'?
