Requirements

    Ploneboard requires Zope 2.9.7 And Plone 2.5.3 or later

    If you want to support attachments the SimpleAttachment product is
    also required.

Installing Ploneboard

  To install Ploneboard, uncompress the product into
  your zope/Products directory or link it there, e.g.::

    ln -s /path/to/installation /path/to/zope/Products

  Install using Site Setup -> Add/Remove Products as usual

The manager should now be able to instantiate a Ploneboard from 
within Plone.
