WORKFLOWS:

CMFMember uses workflow to control the fields available
on base_view and base_edit.

Here are the states:

New: A member being created by Anonymous.  There is no
object in acl_users corresponding to such a member.

Pending: A locked member object awaiting approval.  Locking
is done via an automatic workflow transition.  There is no
object in acl_users corresponding to such a member.  If a
Manager creates a new member, the member is automatically
registered; otherwise members must be registered by a manager
via a process analogous to document review.

Registered - public: A registered member connected to a User
object in acl_users.  The requisite object is created upon
registration.  The member appears in catalog searches and people
can access public information about the member (full name, email
address, etc)

Registered - private: A registered member connected to a User
object in acl_users.  The requisite object is created upon
registration.  The member does not appear in catalog searches 
and people can NOT access public information about the member 
(full name, email address, etc)


LARGE SITES w/LOTS of MEMBERS:

CMFMember uses a BTreeFolder to store the members in, so your site
should be able to scale to many thousands of users with no issues
(from the Member POV anyways ;) )

WARNING: The default Zope user folder (acl_users) is NOT a
BTreeFolder, so be aware.
