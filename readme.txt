DCWorkflowGraph

    DCWorkflowGraph is a DCWorkflow graphic viewer now. It uses Graphviz. I want to make it a graphic editor for DCWorkflow, just like what OpenFlowEditor does.

    DCWorkflowGraph is at "collective":http://sf.net/projects/collective.

Require

    "Graphviz":http://www.graphviz.org

Install

    see install.txt

How to use it:

    Go to ZMI portal_workflow/your_workflow, there is a new tab called
'graph', click it and you will see the workflow graph!
