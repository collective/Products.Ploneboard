              <span class="boxtab">What's GRUF ?</span>
              <div class="boxcontent">
                <p>GRUF is a convenient tool to manage groups of users within Zope.</p>
                <p>It works as a frontend between a Zope application relying on a UserFolder and 
                  a set of two regular UserFolders : one will store the users and the other one 
                  will store the groups.</p>
                <p>It has a whole bunch of cool features, especially :</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It <b>doesn't patch anything</b> in Zope ;</li>
                  <li>It integrates smoothly without the need of any additional form (some are 
                    provided but it's only for convenience) ;</li>
                  <li>It doesn't store users by itself but delegates that job to another User 
                    Folder. So, it <b>works with virtually ANY Zope UserFolder</b> in there ! (especially 
                    standard acl_users but also LDAPUserFolder, SimpleUserFolder, ...) ;</li>
                  <li>It supports <b>groups nesting</b> (ie. groups can belong to other groups and 'inherit' their roles</li>
                  <li>It allows groups and users to be stored in a separated backend (eg. groups in ZODB and users in LDAP, ...);</li>
                  <li>It supports (since 2.0 version) <b>multiple user sources</b>, ie. you can have a bunch of users in LDAP plus
                    some users in a standard User Folder, and they all will be integrated to GRUF;</li>
                  <li>It provides <b>clean management screens</b> (including user and groups editing interfaces) ;</li>
                  <li>It provides <b>security auditing tools</b> ;</li>
                  <li>It's compatible with regular Zope UserFolder API ;</li>
                  <li>Groups are seen as regular Zope users in applications that doesn't include 
                    groups support. Thus, <b>you don't have to rewrite anything to gain benefit from 
                      GRUF's groups</b> !</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>GRUF has been designed by the <a href="http://www.ingeniweb.com">Ingeniweb</a> team.</p>

                <p>And, of course, it's Open-Source (GPL licence for versions &lt; 2.0, ZPL licence otherwise). </p>

              <a name="how"/>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <span class="boxtab">How does-it work ?</span>
              <div class="boxcontent">
                <p> GroupUserFolder is a kind of user folder that provides a special kind of 
                  user management.
                  Some users are &quot;flagged&quot; as GROUP and then normal users will be 
                  able to belong to one or
                  serveral groups.</p>
                <p> Group and &quot;normal&quot; User management is distinct. Here's a typical 
                  GroupUserFolder hierarchy::</p>
                <pre>
     - acl_users (GroupUserFolder)
     |
     |-- Users (GroupUserFolder-related class)
     | |
     | |-- acl_users (UserFolder or derived class)
     |
     |-- Groups (GroupUserFolder-related class)
     | |
     | |-- acl_users (UserFolder or derived class)
     . .
     . .
     . .
                </pre>
                <p>
                  So, INSIDE the GroupUserFolder (or GRUF), there are 2 acl_users :</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> The one in the 'Users' object manages real users</li>
                  <li> The one in the 'Groups' object manages groups</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The two acl_users are completely independants. They can even be of different 
                  kinds.<br>
                  For example, a Zope UserFolder for Groups management and an LDAPUserFolder 
                  for Users management.</p>
                <p> Inside the &quot;Users&quot; acl_users, groups are seen as ROLES (that's 
                  what we call &quot;groles&quot;) so that 
                  roles can be assigned to users using the same storage as regular users. Groups 
                  are prefixed
                  by &quot;group_&quot; so that they could be easily recognized within roles.</p>
                <p> Then, on the top GroupUserFolder, groups and roles both are seen as users, 
                  and users have their
                  normal behaviour (ie. &quot;groles&quot; are not shown), except that users 
                  affected to one or several groups
                  have their roles extended with the roles affected to the groups they belong 
                  to.</p>
                <p>
                  Just for information : one user can belong to zero, one or more groups.
                  One group can have zero, one or more users affected.</p>

                  <li><strong>CMF ?</strong> Yes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Plone ?</strong> Yes. There are even additional forms and tools for Zope to gain full benefit of group information.
                    But these are completely optional and Plone can work without. GRUF will be integrated to Plone 1.1</li>
                  <li><strong>Zope standalone ?</strong> Yes (Zope >= 2.5) and it's a major requirement for us. GRUF will always work
                    with existing Zope 2.x (> 2.5), without the need to add, patch, modify or do anything to make it work.</li>
                  <li><strong>My existing Zope application ?</strong> Yes, provided you do not use non-official security functions.
                    GRUF is completely transparent.</li>
                  <li><strong>LDAPUserFolder ?</strong> Yes, with groups beeing stored in LDAP database or not.<br />
                    Users and groups adding/editing <b>is</b> supported starting from GRUF 3.0Beta1 version. <br />
                        LDAPUF doesn't comply with standard Zope security API for this part so we had to monkeypatch it.<br />
              <strong>Please read the README-LDAP file</strong> provided in the "links" section of this document.</li>
                  <li><strong>ExUserFolder ?</strong> Yes, except for GRUF 1.3 version. GRUF 1.31 is reported to work again with XUF.</li>
                  <li><strong>SimpleUserFolder ?</strong> Yes.</li>

                  GRUF is shipped as a tarball for Zope. See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/collective">The Collective Project</a> for more information.<br />
                  And don't forget that even if GRUF is hosted by a Plone-related project, <b>GRUF independent from Plone !</b></p>

                <ol>
                    <p>
                      All GRUF versions are backward compatible, and then doesn't require you to do anything to <strong>upgrade</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      All GRUF versions within the same major number are <b>upward compatible</b>, that is to say that you can replace your version
                      by a previous one without loosing your user data. This is false for versions having a different major number (O.x and 1.x for example).<br />
                      So, if you notice a bug in the newest version, you can always decide to get back in time ! :-)

                    <strong>Can I nest some GRUFs ?</strong><br />
                    Maybe... but what for ?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Does GRUF support nested groups ?</strong><br />
                    Nested groups in group-whithin-a-group feature. <br />
                    And, yes, GRUF supports it since 1.3 version.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Does GRUF support multiple user sources ?</strong><br />
                    Multiple user sources is a feature that would allow you to store users in several userfolders.
                    For example, you could have your regular admin users in a standard User Folder, your intranet
                    users in an LDAPUserFolder and your extranet users in an SQL-based user folder<br />
                    GRUF supports this from version 2.0Beta1.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Can I use GRUF outside Plone ?</strong><br />
                    Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. This is a major design consideration for us.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Is GRUF stable ?</strong><br />
                    It's used in a production environment for several major websites. Furthermore, it's qualified to be included
                    in Plone 1.1. It's considered reliable enough - except for "Beta" versions, of course.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Is GRUF maintained ?</strong><br />
                    Yes, it is, actively. Features (especially regarding useablility) are often 
                    added to GRUF. Official releases are considered very stable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Can I help ?</strong><br />
                    Yes, for sure !<br />
                    GRUF is an Open-Source project and we, at Ingeniweb, are always happy to help people getting involved
                    with our products. Just contact us to submit your ideas, patches or insults ! :-)<br />
                    <strong>In any case, if you want to work on GRUF's CVS, please work in a branch, never on the HEAD!</strong><br />
                    I want this to ensure the latest CVS HEAD is always very stable.
