    Added a de (German) translation for ZMI

    Reimplemented hook to register own negotiaton method into 
    Negotiator which was stripped out in 1.0beta1


1.0beta1 - 2003-10-??

    Internationalized our own page templates (for ZMI) and added a
    pt_BR translation

    Generalized the Negotiator so that it may negotiate any header in
    the "accept" format

1.0alpha2 - 2003-09-26

    Some primitive DTML support

    Fixed persistence issues that were arising from having the same
    object stored in the ZODB and in a module-level global var (thanks
    to Sidnei)

1.0alpha1 - 2003-08-27

    Removed dependency from PAX

    Now PTS looks for an "i18n" subdirectory under each Product
    package, which makes it easier to package/install i18n-aware
    products.  The i18n dir on INSTANCE_HOME is still kept, you can
    use it for local overrides

    Improvements on the ZMI usability

0.5 - 2003-03-31

    Now we have a ZMI (Zope Management Interface) in Zope's Control
    Panel.  You can use it to refresh catalogs without restarting, and
    to test installed catalogs

    Some functions at module-level are exported for use in Python
    Scripts and Page Templates (Open or Z): negotiate(), translate(),
    getLanguages(), getLanguageName()

    Added a "hotfix" to StringIO that should make PTS work with ZPT
    without UnicodeError being raised constantly

0.4 - 2003-02-03

    Relicensed to GPL

    Now it really works with ZPT (thoroughly tested)

    If used with OpenPT, it will use the output encoding negotiation
    hooks

    Negotiator now uses a cache (stored in the request) to speed
    things up

    Can now use multiple catalogs for the same domain (but the order
    in which they are checked is a bit randomic)

    Special thanks to Magnus Heino for the ZPT support hints and
    patches

0.3 - 2003-01-02

  This release marked the split of PlacelessTranslationService into
  its own package, and the initial attempts at making it compatible
  with ZPT.

0.2 - 2002-09-22

0.1 - 2002-08-24
