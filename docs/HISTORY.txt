Changelog
=========

2.1 - Unreleased
----------------


2.0 - March 14, 2008
--------------------

- Index newly added comments so all their data is correct in the catalog.
  [wichert]

- Rework the RSS feed: make the Ploneboard RSS feed work recursively so
  a feed on a forum shows all conversations and a feed on the board itself
  shows all comments from all fora. Enabled feeds on the Ploneboard type.
  [wichert]

- Remove the object_provides index from Ploneboard: Plone 3.0 has a much
  more efficient version of that itself.
  [wichert]

- Add an explicit visualClear below the 'start new conversation' button
  so it does not overlap the table. This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/161
  [wichert]

- In preparation of PLIP195 being merged for Plone 3.1: declare
  Products.SimpleAttachment as a dependency in our GS profile.
  [wichert]

_ Update the Lithuanian translation. This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/164
  [wichert]

- Correct the attachment size vocabulary: the values should be integers,
  not strings. This fixes http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/168
  as well as http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/144
  [wichert]

- Honour the content-type for comments when transforming them. Doing things
  like replacing newlines with <br/> on text/html comments is kind of silly.
  [wichert].

--------------------------

- Make the comment-icon a link to the comment. This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/ploneboard/issues/78

  would loose the attachments.

  entered text.
  [wichert]
